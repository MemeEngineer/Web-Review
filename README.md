Phase 2 Project for Flatiron Coding BootCamp Using React

Created a movie app with a Spider-man theme

The app uses a db.json file and that is where we will be pulling the data from.

Requirements
You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app (X)
Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized (X) (7 Components)
There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-router (Links to an external site.)(x) (NavBar)
Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required. (x) 
You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project. (x) (using db.json file to GET, and POST)
