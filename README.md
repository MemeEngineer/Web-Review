Phase 2 Project for Flatiron Coding BootCamp Using React

Created a movie app with a Spider-man theme

The app uses a db.json file and that is where we will be pulling the data from.

Frontend:
-npm start

backend (db.json)
-npm run server

Requirements
You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized 
There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-router (Links to an external site.)
Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required. 
You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
